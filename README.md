# Part 1: Introduction and Installation

`JPA` is an R package for identifying MS2 recognition and targeted list features and performing
integrated feature extraction and annotation. The package is written in
the language R and its source code is publicly available at
<https://github.com/HuanLab/JPA.git>.

To install `JPA` package R version 4.0.0 or above is required, and we
recommend using RStudio to complete the installation and usage of
`JPA` by following the steps below:

``` r
# Install "BiocManager" package from CRAN if you do not already have it installed.
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")
    
# Install "devtools" package from CRAN if you do not already have it installed.
if (!requireNamespace("devtools", quietly = TRUE)){
    install.packages("devtools")
}

# Load "devtools" package.
library(devtools)

# Install "JPA" from Github using "devtools".
if (!requireNamespace("JPA", quietly = TRUE)){
  install_github("HuanLab/JPA")
}

# Load "JPA" package.
library(JPA)
```

# Part 2: MS1 level 1 & 2 Feature Extraction

`JPA` supports multiple ways to generate an MS1 featuretable and to
label features as either level 1 or 2. Users can choose to use `XCMS` to
extract features from mzXML files (Section 2.1) or upload their own
featuretable in csv format generated by other commonly used data
processing software (Section 2.2). For the rest of the tutorial, to view
details and additional parameters of functions, type:
`help("<function name>")`. Note: for multi-sample analysis, sample
alignment is performed after level 3 and target features have been
identified. It will be discussed in section 5.

## 2.1 XCMS Feature Extraction

One or multiple mzXML files from DDA analyses can be analyzed at once
using XCMS to extract MS1 level 1 & 2 features. All mzXML file(s) need
to be placed in a separate folder containing no other irrelevant mzXML
files. Additional details of XCMS algorithm is available at their
official website at: <https://rdrr.io/bioc/xcms/man/>.

``` r
# dir specifies the full directory of the folder containing mzXML file(s).
dir = "X:/Users/Sam_Shen/IPAtest_20210330/multiDDA"

# The XCMS.featureTable() function outputs a dataframe formatted featuretable as well as an MSnbase object.
# The "level" column shows the level of each feature.
featureTable <- XCMS.featureTable(dir = dir, mz.tol = 10, ppm=10, peakwidth=c(5,20), mzdiff = 0.01,
                             snthresh = 6, integrate = 1, prefilter = c(3,100), noise = 100)
head(featureTable)
```

## 2.2 Custom Featuretable Input

When using a custom featuretable (eg. from MS-DIAL, MZmine2, etc) for
`IPA` analyses, in order for `IPA` to successfully read the provided CSV
file, it must contain only columns in the following order: m/z,
retention time, min retention time, max retention time, intensity. For
multi-sample analysis, a CSV feature table needs to be provided for each
single mzXML file to be analyzed. Aligned feature table is not
acceptable. All CSV file(s) of interest need to be placed in a separate
folder containing no other irrelevant CSV files. Note: column 3 and
column 4 are the retention time of the feature edges, and all three
columns containing retention time information should be in seconds.

``` r
# ft_directory specifies the directory of the custom csv file(s).
FTdir = "X:/Users/Sam_Shen/IPAtest_20210330/multiDDA"
# dir specifies the full directory of the folder containing mzXML file(s).
dir = "X:/Users/Sam_Shen/IPAtest_20210330/multiDDA"

# Sample csv feature table.
setwd(FTdir)
head(read.csv(list.files(pattern = ".csv")[1], header = T, stringsAsFactors = F))
```

# Part 3: Level 3 Feature Identification

After level 1 and 2 features have been extracted, level 3 feature
identification can be performed. This step is optional.

``` r
# Find level 3 features and add them to the original feature table.
featureTable <- find.level3features(data = MSdata)
```

# Part 4: Add Target Features

After extracting all level 1, 2, and 3 features, users may also want to
extract features from an in-house library of standard metabolites with
given mass and retention time information. If these features already
exists in the original feature table as either level 1, 2, or 3
features, they will not be added. Otherwise, these features will be
explored from the raw data and added to the feature table with “target”
as their level if exist. The in-house metabolites library must be in CSV
format with ONLY the columns “mz” and “rt” in order. This step is
optional.

``` r
# Directory containing the in-house standard metabolite library.
tarFTdir = "X:/Users/Sam_Shen/IPAtest_20210330"
# Name of the in-house standard metabolite library in CSV format.
tarFTname = "LibraryCSVHILIC-.csv"

# Sample format of in-house standard metabolite library.
setwd(tarFTdir)
head(read.csv(tarFTname, header = T, stringsAsFactors = F))
```

    ##         mz  rt

    ## 4  88.0393 444
    ## 5  89.0233 468
    ## 6 101.0244 720

``` r
# Extract target feature and add them to the original featuretable if they do no exist already.
featureTable <- find.targetfeatures(data = MSdata, tarFTdir = tarFTdir, tarFTname = tarFTname)
# Target features that are newly added.
head(featureTable[featureTable$level == "target",])
```

    ##          mz  rt rtmin rtmax maxo sample  level
    ## F68 88.0393 444   444   444  402      1 target
    ## F69 88.0393 444   444   444  402      1 target
    ## F70 88.0393 444   444   444  330      2 target
    ## F71 88.0393 444   444   444  330      2 target
    ## F72 88.0393 444   444   444  512      3 target
    ## F73 88.0393 444   444   444  512      3 target

# Part 5: Sample Alignment

For multi-sample analysis, sample alignment is performed after all level
1, 2, 3, and target features have been identified. Do not perform sample
alignment for single-sample analysis.

``` r
# Update feature table to aligned feature table for multi-sample analysis.
featureTable <- peak.alignment(data = MSdata, bw = 5, minfrac = 0.5, mzwid = 0.015,
                               minsamp = 1, max = 100, quantitative.method = "maxo")
head(featureTable)
```

# Part 6: MS2 Annotation

Feature annotation is performed by two functions: “ms2.tofeaturetable”
for assigning MS2 to each corresponding feature, and then
“feature.annotation” for comparing each MS2 against a standard MS2
library for spectra similarity based metabolite annotation. The standard
library used to perform annotation must be in msp format.

``` r
# The ms2.tofeaturetable() function assigns MS2 spectra to the MS1 feature table. It returns a new feature table with additional columns containing MS2 fragment information.
featureTable <- ms2.tofeaturetable(data = MSdata, featureTable = featureTable)

# Now, use the feature.annotation() function to annotate features in the feature table against a standard database in msp format. This functions returns a feature table containing additional columns with annotation information.
lib_directory <- "X:/Users/Sam_Shen/Library" # directory containing the library file
lib_name <- "convertedLibraryNeg.msp" # name of the library file
featureTable <- feature.annotation(featureTable = featureTable, lib_directory = lib_directory, lib_name = lib_name, dp = 0.1)
# Display some annotated features.
head(featureTable[featureTable$Annotation != "unknown",])
```

# Part 7: Export EIC

EICs can be exported for all level 1, 2, 3, target, or aligned features
individually. For multi-sample analysis, if users want to export level
1, 2, 3, or target features’ EIC separately, then this step must be
performed before sample alignment. Otherwise, only aligned features’ EIC
can be exported because the information of level 1, 2, 3 and target will
not remain in the aligned feature table.

``` r
# Directory to export EICs to.
plotdir <- "X:/Users/Sam_Shen/IPAtest_20210330"

# Draw and export EICs of all level 1 features.
plot.features(dir = plotdir, featureTable = featureTable, data = MSdata, plot.type = 1, smooth = 2)
# Draw and export EICs of all level 2 features.
plot.features(dir = plotdir, featureTable = featureTable, data = MSdata, plot.type = 2, smooth = 2)
# Draw and export EICs of all level 3 features.
plot.features(dir = plotdir, featureTable = featureTable, data = MSdata, plot.type = 3, smooth = 2)
# Draw and export EICs of all level target features.
plot.features(dir = plotdir, featureTable = featureTable, data = MSdata, plot.type = "target", smooth = 2)

# ONLY for multi-sample analysis AND after alignment, draw and export EICs of all aligned features.
plot.features(dir = plotdir, featureTable = featureTable, data = MSdata, plot.type = "multi", smooth = 2)
```

# Part 8: CAMERA Annotation

At the end of the IPA workflow, users can use CAMERA to identify adduct
and isotope relationships in the feature table. Note: CAMERA annotation
can ONLY be used for single-sample `IPA` analysis.

``` r
# Perform CAMERA annotation.
featureTable <- adduct.isotope.annotation(featureTable = featureTable, data = MSdata, polarity = "negative")
```
